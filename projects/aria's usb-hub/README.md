# USB-HUB


I'm making a usb-hub, 4 in 1 adapter. It allows you to input up to 4 USB-As from one port.

It is going to cost 2$, plus the shipping cost which is around 24$ (so a total of 26$).

This is my first PCB. Generally the design process was pretty easy; thanks to the tutorial 
I understood how to use EasyEDA quite quickly and, once I got the hang of it, I continued 
without the tutorial.
